# NHL Game Plot Generator
This personal project of mine collects data provided by the NHL for every NHL game. 
It creates a summary table of important game stats, several plots of important game stats, and maps of important game events.

The `myNHLstats.py` file contains two classes that will create either the summary table and plots OR the events map. 
The `Game Plots & Maps Generator.ipynb` file is a jupyter notebook that can be used to call the modules in myNHLstats 
and quickly create useful visuals for any game that has been, or is being, played.

The hope is that through this project, I can come up with new and interesting ways to calculate momentum within a game.
Also, as puck tracking technology progresses, I hope to improve the location accuracy for maps and calculate new stats that 
more accurately capture the intended meaning of advance stats such as CORSI.
