# Python-Projects
This repository contains various branches with a few of my own Python projects focused on financial and hockey stat analysis.
My projects are either adaptations of articles written on Medium, or are projects I've managed from start to finish.
Projects that are adaptations or use code provided from public forums, such as stackoverflow, should be properly cited. I am still working on adding in full citations.

# Navigatation
To browse the various projects you will need to select the different branches of this repository. 
Many of the projects utilize jupyter notebooks and are presented as .ipynb files. My projects also heavily rely on the matplotlib and plotly packages.
As of this posting, .ipynb files can be opened and processed in Azure Data Studio or Visual Studio, but do not support the GUI's necessary for the mpl and plotly packages.
I recommend opening these projects in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
